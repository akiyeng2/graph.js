{"name":"Graph.js","tagline":"A graphing library in Javascript","body":"graph.js\r\n========\r\n\r\nGraph.js is a Javascript library for graphing functions, lines, points and more. It is written in Microsoft's Typescript but is compiled to ECMAScript 5 Javascript so it can be used in browsers or [nodewebkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit). A live demo is viewable [here](http://scrblnrd3.github.io/graph.js/demo.html)\r\n\r\n#Features\r\n\r\n+ Includes a built-in equation parser for ease of entering equatiosn\r\n+ Adding elements to the graph is fast and simple\r\n+ Provides a graph with intervals at round numbers\r\n+ Graph interface is easy to manipulate to achieve different looks\r\n+ Allows for dragging and zooming with mouse movements\r\n+ Tracing enabled within the graph to find values at specific points\r\n\r\n#Getting started\r\n\r\nDownload the zip file or type `$ git clone https://github.com/scrblnrd3/graph.js.git` into the command line. Run `bower install` to install jQuery and jQuery mousewheel or include them from your favorite CDN in a webpage.\r\n\r\n#Dependencies\r\n\r\n+ [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)\r\n+ [jQuery-mousewheel](https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel)\r\n+ [Fraction.js](https://github.com/ekg/fraction.js)\r\n\r\n#Usage\r\n\r\nTo use this, create an HTML page with a `<canvas>` tag, and specify the dimensions and provide an id. In your Javascript, initialize a new Graph object by\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');\r\nvar graph = new Graph(canvas); //Specify options here such as window and colors\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding elements to the graph is easy. So far you can add points, lines, and mathematical functions\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar point1 = new Point(1, 3);\r\nvar point2 = new Point(5, 2);\r\n\r\nvar line = new Line(point1, point2);\r\ngraph.add(line);\r\n\r\nvar fn = new Expression(\"sin(2x)cos(x)\");\r\ngraph.add(fn);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo remove elements from the graph, enter `graph.remove(element)`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
